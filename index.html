<h1>True Words</h1>

What Is the Library?

Is quiet, It's empty,  It smells good like old books

A charming recommendation

The book can change a reader's life

It asks a question, 

Where is the library?

A place where you can find a lot of books

Where you sit all morning

They have challenges

...the book I am reading

With sentences found from the forest 

As we are speaking

They might whisper secrets

I went, I read, I stayed
