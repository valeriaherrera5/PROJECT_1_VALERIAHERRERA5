<h1>True Words</h1>
<h2>By Valeria Herrera</h2>

<p>What Is the Library?
  <br>Is quiet, It's empty,  It smells good like old books
  <br>A charming recommendation 
  <br>The book can change a reader's life
</p>

<img src="library2.jpg" alt="A library filled with bookshelves and brightly lit">  

<p>It asks a question,
  <br>Where is the library?
  <br>A place where you can find a lot of books
  <br>Where you sit all morning
</p>

<p>They have challenges
  <br>...the book I am reading
  <br>With sentences found from the forest
  <br>As we are speaking
</p>

<img src="novel.jpg" alt="A book called What you are looking for is in the library">

<p>They might whisper secrets
  <br>I went, I read, I stayed
