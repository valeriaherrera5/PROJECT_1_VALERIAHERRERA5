<h1>True Words</h1>
<p>What Is the Library?</p>

</body>
</html>



Is quiet, It's empty,  It smells good like old books

A charming recommendation

The book can change a reader's life

It asks a question, 

Where is the library?

A place where you can find a lot of books

Where you sit all morning

They have challenges

...the book I am reading

With sentences found from the forest 

As we are speaking

They might whisper secrets

I went, I read, I stayed
