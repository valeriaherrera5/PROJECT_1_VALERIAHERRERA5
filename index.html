<h1>True Words</h1>
<h2>By Valeria Herrera</h2>

<p>What Is the Library?</p>
  <br>Is quiet, It's empty,  It smells good like old books
  <br>A charming recommendation 
  <br>The book can change a reader's life

<p>It asks a question,</p>
  <br>Where is the library?
  <br>A place where you can find a lot of books
  <br>Where you sit all morning

They have challenges

...the book I am reading

With sentences found from the forest 

As we are speaking

They might whisper secrets

I went, I read, I stayed
